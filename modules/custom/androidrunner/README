This module uses a modified version of the ready to use of DroidBox from
https://code.google.com/p/droidbox. DroidBox uses the adb tools to communicate
with the the emulator. Make sure that the Android SDK and the adb tools are
installed for the user running the irma probe. 

Before using the module, setup a new AVD targeting Android 4.1.2 and choose
Nexus 4 as device as well as ARM as CPU type by running the android command.
Download the images from the ready to use version of DroidBox from google
code and put them in DroidBox_4.1.1/images/ .

Once it is done, you should be able to analyse an application with this module.
